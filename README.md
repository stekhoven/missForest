missForest
==========

missForest is a nonparametric, mixed-type imputation method for basically any type of data.  
Here, we host the R-package "missForest" for the statistical software R.  

The method is based on the publication Stekhoven and Bühlmann, 2012. The R package contains 
a vignette on how to use "missForest" in R including many helpful examples.  Upcoming 
innovations: 

- use of prediction 
- 'real' multiple imputation 
- parallelization capabilities

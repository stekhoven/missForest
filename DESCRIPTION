Description: The function 'missForest' is used to impute missing values
    in mixed-type data. It uses random forests trained on the observed
    values of a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can impute
    continuous and/or categorical data including complex interactions and
    non-linear relations. The method yields an out-of-bag (OOB) imputation
    error estimate without the need of a test set or cross-validation and
    supports parallel computation. The package now defaults to a
    'ranger'-backed implementation with an optional 'randomForest'
    backend for compatibility.
